\abstract{Radio-frequency (RF) antenna design traditionally proceeds in three phases.  First, the design performance is modeled with expensive and proprietary computational electromagnetism (CEM) software.  Second, the design is fabricated using expensive metal machine tools.  Third, the fabricated design is characterized using benchtop RF measurement tools.  The traditional process can include machine learning algorithms for optimization.  We have developed an open-source alternative process that utilizes the MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagator (MEEP) CEM package for design and simulation, and 3D printing with conductive filament for fabrication.  Following this process, we designed and fabricated an RF horn antenna.  To characterize our design, we show that the E-plane and H-plane radiation patterns, the VSWR, and the cross-polarization ratios match our CEM calculations.  These results indicate that our design performs just like a linearly polarized, broadband RF horn antenna in the [5.5-6] GHz bandwidth.  Because the bandwidth of our instrumenation is limited to 6 GHz, and because our CEM calculations predict good performance above 6 GHz, we conclude the bandwidth of our printed design extends above 6 GHz.  Future work will include expanding to lower bandwidth by fabricating larger RF horns, and fabricating a broadband RF phased array.}

\section{Introduction}

Broadband RF antennas are ubiquitous tools within scientific instrumentation and communication applications.  Traditionally, RF antennas are designed using expensive, proprietary software packages, like XFDTD and HFSS \cite{hfss,xfdtd}.  Designs are fabricated by cutting and shaping metal with precision machine tools.  This technique is sometimes called \textit{subtractive manufacturing}, as opposed to \textit{additive manufacturing.}  Compared to \textit{additive manufacturing} techniques, subtractive manufacturing can be costly \cite{segoviaguerrero2025additive-29b,add_vs_sub}.  Open-source additive manufacturing would boost cost efficiency in RF antenna design and fabrication.

Previously, J. C. Hanson (2021) demonstrated that the MEEP software package may be used as an RF antenna design tool \cite{hanson2021broadband-cab}.  MEEP operates via the FDTD algorithm for Maxwell's Equations on a Yee lattice \cite{10.1016/j.cpc.2009.11.008}.  Specifically, the author of \cite{hanson2021broadband-cab} produced RF phased array designs in two and three dimensions using MEEP code.  The designs included broadband RF horn elements in the [0.5-5] GHz bandwidth.  Further, J. C. Hanson demonstrated that open-source CAD software may be used to create complex designs that can be 3D-printed \cite{meepcon_hanson}.

\section{Materials and Methods}

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly avail-able database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.

In this section, where applicable, authors are required to disclose details of how gen-erative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has been used in this paper (e.g., to generate text, data, or graphics, or to assist in study design, data collection, analysis, or interpretation). The use of GenAI for superficial text editing (e.g., grammar, spelling, punctuation, and formatting) does not need to be declared.

\section{Results}

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}
%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
\end{adjustwidth}
%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.


Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase ``of Theorem 1'' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
