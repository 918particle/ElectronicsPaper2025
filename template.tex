\section{Introduction}

The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the principal conclusions. As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research. Citing a journal paper  \cite{ref-journal}.  Now citing a book reference  \cite{ref-book1,ref-book2} or other reference types  \cite{ref-unpublish,ref-url}. Please use the command  \cite{ref-proceeding,ref-thesis} for the following MDPI journals, which use author--date citation: Administrative Sciences, Arts, Behavioral Sciences, Businesses, Econometrics, Economies, Education Sciences, European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education, Games, Genealogy, Histories, Humanities, Humans, IJFS, Journal of Intelligence, Journalism and Media, JRFM, Languages, Laws, Literature, Psychology International, Publications, Religions, Risks, Social Sciences, Tourism and Hospitality, Youth. 

\section{Materials and Methods}

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly avail-able database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.

In this section, where applicable, authors are required to disclose details of how gen-erative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has been used in this paper (e.g., to generate text, data, or graphics, or to assist in study design, data collection, analysis, or interpretation). The use of GenAI for superficial text editing (e.g., grammar, spelling, punctuation, and formatting) does not need to be declared.

\section{Results}

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.

\subsection{Subsection}
\subsubsection{Subsubsection}

Bulleted lists look like this:
\begin{itemize}
\item	First bullet;
\item	Second bullet;
\item	Third bullet.
\end{itemize}

Numbered lists can be added as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	First item; 
\item	Second item;
\item	Third item.
\end{enumerate}

The text continues here.

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Schemes}

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure~\ref{fig1}, Table~\ref{tab1}, etc.

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}
%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
\end{adjustwidth}
%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.


Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase ``of Theorem 1'' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
The text continues here.

\section{Discussion}

Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted from the perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.

\section{Conclusions}

This section is not mandatory, but can be added to the manuscript if the discussion is unusually long or complex.

In this section, please provide details regarding where data supporting reported results can be found, including links to publicly archived datasets analyzed or generated during the study. Where no new data were created, or where data is unavailable due to privacy or ethical restrictions, a statement is still required. Suggested Data Availability Statements are available in section ``MDPI Research Data Policies'' at \url{https://www.mdpi.com/ethics}.} 

\acknowledgments{In this section you can acknowledge any support given which is not covered by the author contribution or funding sections. This may include administrative and technical support, or donations in kind (e.g., materials used for experiments). Where GenAI has been used for purposes such as generating text, data, or graphics, or for study design, data collection, analysis, or interpretation of data, please add “During the preparation of this manuscript/study, the author(s) used [tool name, version information] for the purposes of [description of use]. The authors have reviewed and edited the output and take full responsibility for the content of this publication.”}

\conflictsofinterest{Declare conflicts of interest or state ``The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'' Authors must identify and declare any personal circumstances or interest that may be perceived as inappropriately influencing the representation or interpretation of reported research results. Any role of the funders in the design of the study; in the collection, analyses or interpretation of data; in the writing of the manuscript; or in the decision to publish the results must be declared in this section.

\subsection[\appendixname~\thesubsection]{}
The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text---for example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data are shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary Data. Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.
