  abstract = {Communication, radar and remote sensing systems employ thousands of different types of wire antennas, and there is an increasing need for high-performance, customized antennas. Current methods of designing and optimizing them by hand using simulation or analysis are time- and labor-intensive, limit complexity, increase the cost and time expended, and require that antenna engineers have significant knowledge of the universe of antenna designs. Local optimization methods are not much better, since an initial guess that is close to the final design must be provided. Using a genetic algorithm ({GA}), it is possible to prescribe the desired performance of an antenna and allow the computer to find the parameters for the design. The {GA} does not require an initial guess, and the amount of design information the engineer must supply can be very minimal. This paper presents a review of a few wire antennas from previous publications designed by {GA} unconventional purposes. This approach has potential to revolutionize antenna design.},

The review concludes that {AI}/{ML} approaches have the capacity to transform antenna design by offering quicker and more precise solutions to complex problems. However, since the field is still in its early stages, continuous research and development are necessary to address these challenges and fully capitalize on the capabilities of {AI}/{ML} in optimizing antenna design.},

  abstract = {Phased array radar systems have a wide variety of applications in engineering and physics research. Phased array design usually requires numerical modeling with expensive commercial computational packages. Using the open-source {MIT} Electrogmagnetic Equation Propagation ({MEEP}) package, a set of phased array designs is presented. Specifically, one and two-dimensional arrays of Yagi-Uda and horn antennas were modeled in the bandwidth [0.1–5] {GHz}, and compared to theoretical expectations in the far-field. Precise matches between {MEEP} simulation and radiation pattern predictions at different frequencies and beam angles are demonstrated. Given that the computations match the theory, the effect of embedding a phased array within a medium of varying index of refraction is then computed. Understanding the effect of varying index on phased arrays is critical for proposed ultra-high energy neutrino observatories which rely on phased array detectors embedded in natural ice. Future work will develop the phased array concepts with parallel {MEEP}, in order to increase the detail, complexity, and speed of the computations.},

A comparative Life Cycle Assessment ({LCA}) and Life Cycle Costing ({LCC}) were conducted to assess a conventional subtractive manufacturing process based on Computer Numerical Control ({CNC}) machining versus a hybrid approach that combines Plasma Arc-Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing ({PA}-{WAAM}) with {CNC} finishing. The {LCA} was carried out using {ReCiPe} 2016 Midpoint and Endpoint methodologies in {SimaPro}, while the {LCC} employed a cradle-to-gate cost model. Results showed that the hybrid {WAAM}-{CNC} route reduced average environmental impacts by 49\% across 18 categories and decreased steel consumption by approximately 70\% due to near-net-shape fabrication. Although the hybrid method incurred an approximate 3.5 times increase in unit production cost, this was primarily attributed to equipment investment. In contrast, operational costs such as labor, materials, and consumables were significantly lower—by 66\%, 28\%, and 45\%, respectively. These findings support the hybrid approach as a more sustainable manufacturing alternative with the potential for long-term cost optimization as additive technologies mature.},

	abstract = {The detection of high energy neutrinos (1015–1020 eV) is an important step toward understanding the most energetic cosmic accelerators and would enable tests of fundamental physics at energy scales that cannot easily be achieved on Earth. In this energy range, there are two expected populations of neutrinos: the astrophysical flux observed with IceCube at lower energies (∼1 PeV) and the predicted cosmogenic flux at higher energies (∼1018 eV) . Radio detector arrays such as RICE, ANITA, ARA, and ARIANNA exploit the Askaryan effect and the radio transparency of glacial ice, which together enable enormous volumes of ice to be monitored with sparse instrumentation. We describe here the design for a phased radio array that would lower the energy threshold of radio techniques to the PeV scale, allowing measurement of the astrophysical flux observed with IceCube over an extended energy range. Meaningful energy overlap with optical Cherenkov telescopes could be used for energy calibration. The phased radio array design would also provide more efficient coverage of the large effective volume required to discover cosmogenic neutrinos.}

The technique is based on coherently summing the impulsive Askaryan signal from multiple antennas, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio for weak signals. We report here on measurements and a simulation of thermal noise correlations between nearby antennas, beamforming of impulsive signals, and a measurement of the expected improvement in trigger efficiency through the phased array technique. We also discuss the noise environment observed with an analog phased array at Summit Station, Greenland, a possible site for an interferometric phased array for radio detection of high energy neutrinos."

abstract = {{Electromagnetic scattering simulation is an extremely wide and interesting field, and its continuous evolution is associated with the development of computing resources. Undeniably, antenna design at all levels strongly relies on electromagnetic simulation software. However, despite the large number and the high quality of the available open-source simulation packages, most companies have no doubts about the choice of commercial program suites. At the same time, in the academic world, it is frequent to develop in-house simulation software, even from scratch and without proper knowledge of the existing possibilities. The rationale of the present paper is to review, from a practical viewpoint, the open-source software that can be useful in the antenna design process. To this end, an introductory overview of the usual design workflow is firstly presented. Subsequently, the strengths and weaknesses of open-source software compared to its commercial counterpart are analyzed. After that, the main open-source packages that are currently available online are briefly described. The last part of this paper is devoted to a preliminary numerical benchmark for the assessment of the capabilities and limitations of a subset of the presented open-source programs. The benchmark includes the calculation of some fundamental antenna parameters for four different typologies of radiating elements.}},
